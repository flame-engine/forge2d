# Examples for Dart Forge2D

If you haven't used `webdev` before you might need to run:

```sh
pub global activate webdev
```

And then you can run:
```sh
pub global run webdev serve example:53322
```

And open http://127.0.0.1:53322 in your browser.

Since this is not running in release mode it will run a lot slower.
If you want to run it in release mode you can run the following:
```sh
pub global run webdev serve --release
```

## Old way

Run:
```sh
./compile.sh
```

and then open index.html in a browser.
