# Examples for Dart Forge2D

If you haven't used `webdev` before you might need to run:

```sh
pub global activate webdev
```

And then you can run:
```sh
pub global run webdev serve
```

And open http://127.0.0.1:8080 in your browser.

Since this is not running in release mode it will run a lot slower.
If you want to run it in release mode you can run the following:
```sh
pub global run webdev serve --release
```
